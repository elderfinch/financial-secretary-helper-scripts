# Financial Secretary Helper Scripts

Hehehe… so you found the secret scripts page. Careful now — these little helpers are highly experimental, dangerously efficient, and known to cause sudden bursts of free time, reduced paperwork stress, and suspiciously accurate reports. Use at your own risk… productivity levels may rise, and you might just finish your work before lunch.

Here's the number one rule of using the Financial Secretary Scripts (FSS): **DELETE THEM WHEN THE AUDITOR OR ICS COMES**. Seriously. Uninstall Tampermonkey (we'll get to that in a minute). We can't have another freakout from the area. They are harmless, but they don't understand that. With that aside, let's begin.

## Installing Tampermonkey

To use the FSS, you need to install a Google Chrome extension called Tampermonkey. What is Tampermonkey you ask? It is a Chrome extension that let's you run a bunch of baby chrome extensions. So instead of installing 17 different Chrome extensions, you can install one and then use as many scripts as you'd like. Pretty neat, huh? To install it click here (for Chrome):

*For other browsers, click here (https://www.tampermonkey.net/index.php)*

*For what it's worth. I highly reccomend installing the adblocker [Ublock Origin Lite](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/uBlock%20Origin%20Lite/ddkjiahejlhfcafbddmgiahcphecmpfh?hl=en): 

## Installing User Scripts

The easiest way to install the user scripts is to go to Elder Finch's profile on a website called Greasy Fork. Greasy Fork is a website that hosts Tampermonkey scripts. Tampermonkey is the garçom and Greasy Fork is the dono; tá ver né?

From there, you should be able to see all the available scripts. 

To install a script, simply click the script link and click "Install This Script"
