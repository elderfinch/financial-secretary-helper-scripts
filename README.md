# Financial Secretary Helper Scripts

Hehehe‚Ä¶ so you found the secret scripts page. Careful now ‚Äî these little helpers are highly experimental, dangerously efficient, and known to cause sudden bursts of free time, reduced paperwork stress, and suspiciously accurate reports. Use at your own risk‚Ä¶ productivity levels may rise, and you might just finish your work before lunch.

These scripts were 99% written by ChatGPT. I did some minor editing and tweaking, but I did not write the code. So if you run into bugs, blame ChatGPT.

## Installing Tampermonkey

To use the FSS, you need to install a Google Chrome extension called Tampermonkey. What is Tampermonkey you ask? It is a Chrome extension that let's you run a bunch of baby chrome extensions. So instead of installing 17 different Chrome extensions, you can install one and then use as many scripts as you'd like. Pretty neat, huh? To install it click here (for Chrome):

*For other browsers, click here (https://www.tampermonkey.net/index.php)*

*For what it's worth. I highly reccomend installing the adblocker [Ublock Origin Lite](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/uBlock%20Origin%20Lite/ddkjiahejlhfcafbddmgiahcphecmpfh?hl=en)*

## Installing User Scripts

The easiest way to install the user scripts is to go to Elder Finch's profile on a website called Greasy Fork. Greasy Fork is a website that hosts Tampermonkey scripts. Tampermonkey is the gar√ßom and Greasy Fork is the dono; t√° ver n√©?

[Click here to see Elder Finch's profile](https://greasyfork.org/en/users/1500121-elderfinch)

From there, you should be able to see all the available scripts. 

To install a script, simply click the script link and click "Install This Script"

The script should now be installed. Repeat this process for all the scripts you wish to install.

## Using the Scripts

Copy Ref-Inv + Payee Link (Vendor Payments Submit)  
</summary>  

**Script runs on:** [https://imos.churchofjesuschrist.org](https://imos.churchofjesuschrist.org) (Payments Submit page)

This script provides two main functions:

1. **Copy Reference‚ÄìInvoice for Receipts**

   * When saving a PDF receipt in IMOS, we prefer to name the file using the IMOS Reference Number and the Invoice Number (e.g., `1VA0XXXX - INVXXXX`).
   * The script adds a monkey üêí button in the bottom-right corner of the Payments page.
   * Clicking this button adds a new column of **Copy Ref ‚Äì Inv** buttons.
   * When you click one of these, the script copies the reference‚Äìinvoice string to your clipboard.
   * You can then paste it as the file name when saving the receipt.

2. **Quick Payee Link**

   * The script also makes the vendor name clickable.
   * Clicking it takes you directly to the vendor‚Äôs recent payments page, saving you the step of searching manually.

Copy Invoice File Name (Vendor Page)  
</summary>  

**Script runs on:** [https://imos.churchofjesuschrist.org](https://imos.churchofjesuschrist.org) (Vendor Summary page)

This script works almost the same way as the Payments Submit version but on the Vendor page.

* When you click the monkey üêí button in the bottom-right corner, a new column of **Copy Ref ‚Äì Inv** buttons appears.
* Clicking one copies the reference‚Äìinvoice string to your clipboard.
* You can then paste it as the PDF file name when saving receipts, instead of manually copying each one.

M-Pesa CSV Extractor (Google Messages)
</summary>

Script runs on: https://messages.google.com/web

This script runs on [https://messages.google.com/web](https://messages.google.com/web).

When doing an M-PESA reconciliation, you need details from your SMS messages: the M-PESA code, transaction amount, date, and fee. This script automates that process. It scans your message history and extracts all transactions, including payments, withdrawals, and POS purchases.

Here‚Äôs how it works:

1. Open your messages, and you‚Äôll see a monkey üêí button in the bottom-right corner.
2. Click the button and select the date from which you want to start scraping M-PESA transactions.
3. Before running the script, scroll through your messages so all of them are loaded and visible on the page.
4. Click Extract. The script will generate and download a CSV containing the phone number, M-PESA code, amount, and fee.

Next, open your Google Sheet with the M-PESA form responses:

* Insert a column next to the Cost column.
* Paste in the costs generated by the script.
* Reorder the Google Form responses to align with the extracted transactions and identify any missing entries.
* Once everything is matched, you can paste in the fees and M-PESA codes.
